If information is the fundamental substance of nature, then how does nature itself come into being?
How do we and everything within it emerge, evolve, and ultimately end within this informational fabric?
How do these bits of information arise, vanish, or become ‘entangled’ into the web we call reality?
Through physics, I try to understand and answer these questions, which to me are not only scientific but deeply personal.
